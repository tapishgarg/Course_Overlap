Principles of nature\u2019s design When nature invents, she bears in mind essential principles of sustainable design. Here the participant will learn and apply those principles to his design. 6. Types of biomimetic design Biomimicry can be about the product you want to create, or the process you want to create or the system you want to create. In this session the participant is encouraged to think about the objective of his design and contextualise it accordingly 7. More detailed look at examples of biomimicry culminating in a term project Participants will do a hands-on exercise to use the learning in an individual or group project.

These \u2018undergraduate research\u2019 credits can also be earned as part of a team project, and such teamwork should be encouraged whenever possible. However, a clear division of responsibility in the initial proposal, as well as individual final reports, emphasizing their personal contributions to the project should be sought for evaluation. Evaluation criteria should be left to the discretion of the departments.  We propose that a B.Tech student be allowed to sign up for a maximum of 3 such courses over the duration of his/her programme, and should be allowed to do so even during the summer term. These credits should count towards free electives.

We will begin with an introduction to simple nonlinear system examples. The notion of equilibrium points and operating points will help us to extract linearized models based on Jacobian linearization.  3. Second-order nonlinear systems occupy a special place in the study of non-linear systems since they are easy to interpret geometrically in the plane. Here, we will touch upon the concept of a vector field, trajectories, vector field plot, phase-plane portrait and positively invariant sets. The classification of equilibrium points based on the eigenvalues of the linearized system will also be introduced and we will see why the analysis based on linearization fails in some cases. Periodic solutions and the notion of limit cycles will lead us to the Bendixson\u2019s theorem and Poincare -Bendixson criteria that provide sufficient conditions to rule-out and rule-in the existence of limit cycles respectively for a second-order system. We will end this discussion with two methods for obtaining approximate solutions of periodic solutions.  4.

Although the concerns of ecofiction have been voiced in earlier eco-writings, this genre perhaps marks the culmination of self-conscious Anthropocene writing. For instance, Jim Dwyer\u2019s field comprehensive guide to ecofiction mentions an entire range of ecofiction examples spanning across time periods ranging from the earliest cave drawings up to the 21st century.  This supergenre became popular with the environmental movements in the 1970s and 80s when disciplines like ecocriticism sought to forge connections between literature and the physical environment. The term \u2018ecofiction\u2019 does not merely function as a subgenre of science fiction, but can be viewed as a super category of all genres that depicts the troubled environmental and material realities of our times. Ecofiction is truly a capacious and elastic term and encompasses a variety of hybrid subgenres like ecopunk, ecotopia, biopunk, solarpunk, climate fiction, Afrofuturismo, environmental weird fiction, postapocalyptic fiction, among others.  For the purposes of this course, the term \u2018ecofiction\u2019 will primarily focus on subgenres in which the role of speculation is vital to the  envisioning of the complex systemic processes that inform anthropogenic global warming like climate change, flooding, resource depletion, impact winter and other eco-crises.These ecospeculative narratives can either present a dystopic and counterfactual present world, an alternative past or an imaginative reality about  sustainable futures.

Each ideology will be set in brief historical context; the main ideas it expresses will be supported with examples. Each ideology will be evaluated with examples from current South Asian and international political issues, using appropriate academic papers and books.  Module 1:  Fascism, Conservatism, and Liberalism. The rise of modern fascism since the mid-19th century. How conservatism expresses respect for the past without becoming fascist, but then faces the challenge of liberal ideas of democracy, rights, and the market.  Module 2:  Marx and Marxism, Anarchism, and Feminism. Marx\u2019s main ideas, and some of the problems Marxist movements face in practice. Non-violent anarchism as starting from a similar point to Marxism but as reaching very different conclusions. Feminism: a challenge which cuts across other ideologies to ensure that women\u2019s position and participation have their rightful place in ideologies and in political life.  Module 3:  Ecologism, Postmodernism and Poststructuralism. The kinds of challenges the global environmental condition poses to previous ideologies and patterns of production and consumption; possible responses including different economic and political systems. Postmodernism and Poststructuralism covers the challenges posed by the failures of previous ideologies as well as the possibility that the very idea of systematic ideologies needs to be abandoned.  Module 4:  Theocracy and Fundamentalism, Technocracy and Managerialism, Republicanism and Citizenship.  In the first case, an attempt is made to take over the democratic space by claiming a form of unquestionable religious authority.  In the second case the respective claims are to technocratic and managerialist knowledge as political authority.  The concluding topic examines the adaptation of Athenian theories of republican democracy and citizenship for today\u2019s times.

Asset Markets: Assets, including financial assets like bonds or corporate stocks, are goods that provide a flow of services, including financial returns like interest or dividend payments, over time. In this chapter we will examine the functioning of asset markets under conditions of complete certainty about the future flow of services provided by the asset.  4. Uncertainty: Complete certainty model of asset returns will be extended for the case if such return is uncertain, since investment in financial markets always involve some risk. Operations of financial institutions such as insurance and stock markets that can mitigate such risks, at least some extent, will also be introduced.   5.

The concerned investment decision will further be extended to her/his decision of selecting an investment portfolio, instead of choosing merely a single asset.   6. Review of the Literature with Methodological developments The first methodological breakthrough in this area came after the development of the theory of choice under uncertainty by von Neumann and Morgenstern (1947). Later Markowitz (1952, 1959) and Tobin (1958) used this theory to formulate and solve the portfolio selection problem. And, researchers developed methodologies to estimate market line empirically in this regard. To improve the precision of estimated market lines, empirical research on finance developed even further with the works of researchers such as Blume (1970), Friend and Blume (1970), Black, Jenson and Scholes (1972) work with portfolios. We would like to discuss all these classic works to provide a thorough understanding of the subject to the student(s).

The basis of petrophysical evaluation in conventional reservoirs involves the simple separation of solids and fluids but is problematic when considering fine grained successions of mudstones, or shale gas plays.  Core analyses must be adapted for these low permeability formations, while traditional logs are best supplemented by more recently developed measurements.  This course will present an overview of mudstones, and how in shale gas plays the physical and chemical properties are central to any petrophysical evaluation. The course starts from the conventional petrophysics viewpoint, considers the nature of mudstone systems, and then uses a variety of approaches appropriate for evaluating shale gas using core and log data within a geological framework.   The course will cover the following items: Introduction to shale gas reservoirs and petrophysical models  Introduction: Shale gas resources and shale gas petrophysics. 1. Shale gas reservoirs. Mudstones: what do we mean by the term shale? Grain size, shape, mineralogy, pore sizes and shapes. Depositional environments, compaction, dewatering, diagenesis, temperature and pressure.

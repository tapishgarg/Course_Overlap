    "CE4901 Undergraduate Research - I": "A student should sign up with a faculty member with a specific proposal of what (s)he expects to accomplish during the course of the semester, including some milestones along the way.  This should be a detailed document, which will be submitted to the HoDs office, signed off by the faculty supervisor, before registration. It is therefore expected that some effort has already gone into thinking of a realistic plan of work. The supervisor should ensure that the proposal entails an amount of work appropriate for the credit received. An undergraduate research course should involve about 105 hours of work over the duration of a semester, including report writing. A report, due at the end of the course, should also serve as a useful experience in documentation and technical writing.   Students spend significant time on such projects, and pick up valuable skills in core engineering.  They also experience the power of teamwork, and hone soft skills in the form of making presentations, explaining their work to a general audience etc. Such activity currently receives no academic credit; and the “undergraduate research” courses are a way of allowing students to involve themselves head-on into such work without overloading themselves.   These ‘undergraduate research’ credits can also be earned as part of a team project, and such teamwork should be encouraged whenever possible. However, a clear division of responsibility in the initial proposal, as well as individual final reports, emphasizing their personal contributions to the project should be sought for evaluation. Evaluation criteria should be left to the discretion of the departments.  We propose that a B.Tech student be allowed to sign up for a maximum of 3 such courses over the duration of his/her programme, and should be allowed to do so even during the summer term.

Though it received severe jolts to its development through high profile accidents such as the Three Mile Island in 1979, Chernobyl in 1986 and Fukushima in 2011, nuclear energy is once again in the reckoning due to widely-shared concerns about global warming and air pollution despite persistent apprehensions and doubts about safety, sustainability and proliferation issues related to exploitation of nuclear power.Course contentsThe course is divided into three modules.  The first module, spread over 24 lectures, discusses the conventional and established technology of nuclear power generation.

    "CS6024 Algorithmic Approaches to Computational Biology": "In each course section below, we start with an intriguing biological question, interactively formulate a computational problem addressing the question, present a key algorithmic technique or statistical model (e.g., dynamic programming, randomization in algorithms, evolutionary tree model) solving the problem, and end with a students-led research paper that will spur a final course project. The idea is to gradually lead students from solved problems in bioinformatics to open research problems and eventually to have them formulate their own fresh research problem.  . Where in the Genome Does DNA Replication Begin? - Algorithmic warmup (frequent exact/inexact k-mers in a string) . Which DNA Patterns Play the Role of Molecular Clocks? - Randomized Algorithms (randomized motif search, Gibbs sampling) . How Do We Assemble Genomes? - Graph Algorithms (Eulerian paths, de Bruijn graphs) . How Do We Compare Biological Sequences? - Dynamic Programming (edit distance, single/multiple sequence alignment) . Which Animal Gave Us SARS? - Evolutionary Tree Reconstruction (distance-based phylogeny, neighbor-joining algorithm) . How Did Yeast Become a Wine Maker? - Clustering Algorithms (hard and soft k-means) . How Do We Locate Disease-Causing Mutations? - Combinatorial Pattern Matching (suffix trees/arrays, Burrows-Wheeler transform) .

We will begin with an introduction to simple nonlinear system examples. The notion of equilibrium points and operating points will help us to extract linearized models based on Jacobian linearization.  3. Second-order nonlinear systems occupy a special place in the study of non-linear systems since they are easy to interpret geometrically in the plane. Here, we will touch upon the concept of a vector field, trajectories, vector field plot, phase-plane portrait and positively invariant sets. The classification of equilibrium points based on the eigenvalues of the linearized system will also be introduced and we will see why the analysis based on linearization fails in some cases. Periodic solutions and the notion of limit cycles will lead us to the Bendixson’s theorem and Poincare -Bendixson criteria that provide sufficient conditions to rule-out and rule-in the existence of limit cycles respectively for a second-order system. We will end this discussion with two methods for obtaining approximate solutions of periodic solutions.  4. Stability notions: Stability is central to control system design and here we will study various notions of stability such as Lagrange stability, Lyapunov stability, asymptotic stability, global asymptotic stability, exponential stability, relative stability and instability. The tools that we will use to infer the stability properties include Lyapunov’s direct and indirect method, La Salle’s invariance property and singular perturbations.

    "HS5130 Ecofiction": "The course on ecofiction aims to introduce students to contemporary ecofiction that engages with environmental issues occupying the centre stage in the Anthropocene. Although the concerns of ecofiction have been voiced in earlier eco-writings, this genre perhaps marks the culmination of self-conscious Anthropocene writing. For instance, Jim Dwyer’s field comprehensive guide to ecofiction mentions an entire range of ecofiction examples spanning across time periods ranging from the earliest cave drawings up to the 21st century.  This supergenre became popular with the environmental movements in the 1970s and 80s when disciplines like ecocriticism sought to forge connections between literature and the physical environment. The term ‘ecofiction’ does not merely function as a subgenre of science fiction, but can be viewed as a super category of all genres that depicts the troubled environmental and material realities of our times. Ecofiction is truly a capacious and elastic term and encompasses a variety of hybrid subgenres like ecopunk, ecotopia, biopunk, solarpunk, climate fiction, Afrofuturismo, environmental weird fiction, postapocalyptic fiction, among others.  For the purposes of this course, the term ‘ecofiction’ will primarily focus on subgenres in which the role of speculation is vital to the  envisioning of the complex systemic processes that inform anthropogenic global warming like climate change, flooding, resource depletion, impact winter and other eco-crises.These ecospeculative narratives can either present a dystopic and counterfactual present world, an alternative past or an imaginative reality about  sustainable futures.

Each ideology will be evaluated with examples from current South Asian and international political issues, using appropriate academic papers and books.  Module 1:  Fascism, Conservatism, and Liberalism. The rise of modern fascism since the mid-19th century. How conservatism expresses respect for the past without becoming fascist, but then faces the challenge of liberal ideas of democracy, rights, and the market.  Module 2:  Marx and Marxism, Anarchism, and Feminism. Marx’s main ideas, and some of the problems Marxist movements face in practice. Non-violent anarchism as starting from a similar point to Marxism but as reaching very different conclusions. Feminism: a challenge which cuts across other ideologies to ensure that women’s position and participation have their rightful place in ideologies and in political life.

The kinds of challenges the global environmental condition poses to previous ideologies and patterns of production and consumption; possible responses including different economic and political systems. Postmodernism and Poststructuralism covers the challenges posed by the failures of previous ideologies as well as the possibility that the very idea of systematic ideologies needs to be abandoned.  Module 4:  Theocracy and Fundamentalism, Technocracy and Managerialism, Republicanism and Citizenship.

Intertemporal Choice: Simple two period intertemporal choices model will be introduced here and will further be extended for the case involving more than two periods. Real life situation involving inflation will also be discussed.  3. Asset Markets: Assets, including financial assets like bonds or corporate stocks, are goods that provide a flow of services, including financial returns like interest or dividend payments, over time. In this chapter we will examine the functioning of asset markets under conditions of complete certainty about the future flow of services provided by the asset.  4. Uncertainty: Complete certainty model of asset returns will be extended for the case if such return is uncertain, since investment in financial markets always involve some risk. Operations of financial institutions such as insurance and stock markets that can mitigate such risks, at least some extent, will also be introduced.   5. Risky Assets Consumer’s optimum choice under uncertainty will be discussed extensively here, including her/his decision to allocate income in consumption and in investment expenditure. The concerned investment decision will further be extended to her/his decision of selecting an investment portfolio, instead of choosing merely a single asset.   6. Review of the Literature with Methodological developments The first methodological breakthrough in this area came after the development of the theory of choice under uncertainty by von Neumann and Morgenstern (1947). Later Markowitz (1952, 1959) and Tobin (1958) used this theory to formulate and solve the portfolio selection problem. And, researchers developed methodologies to estimate market line empirically in this regard. To improve the precision of estimated market lines, empirical research on finance developed even further with the works of researchers such as Blume (1970), Friend and Blume (1970), Black, Jenson and Scholes (1972) work with portfolios. We would like to discuss all these classic works to provide a thorough understanding of the subject to the student(s). We will also discuss Mehra (2006) to have an overall picture of the concerned literature in India, in general and specific issues that are important for Indian financial market, in particular.           Since empirical research on the subject is largely based on the time series data, time series econometrics eventually becomes an integral part of the subject.
